Fullstack / WebAudio / Music / Coffee

## 🎹 All kind of keyboards
From the tactile keys of my laptop to the expressive touch of my synth and MIDI keyboards.

## 🚀 Projects
  - **[Blibliki](https://github.com/mikezaby/blibliki):** A data-driven audio engine for the web and more.
  - **[MyData](https://github.com/mikezaby/my_data):** A Ruby client for AADE MyData.

## 💡 Collaborating
I'm always open to collaborating on audio programming projects or exploring new and interesting ideas. Feel free to reach out if you want to create something together!  

## 📚 Continuous Learning
I am always on the lookout to expand my knowledge and skills. Currently, I am trying to fine tune my WebAudio engine Blibliki, but also I want to explore new fields like re-implementing Blibliki in Rust

## ☕️ Beyond Code and music
I'm on a quest for the perfect home coffee brew. Any tips?
