I'm always open to collaborating on audio programming projects or exploring new and interesting ideas. Feel free to reach out if you want to create something together!  

## 📚 Continuous Learning
I am always on the lookout to expand my knowledge and skills. Currently, I am trying to fine tune my WebAudi engine Blibliki, but also I want to explore new fields like re-implementing Blibliki in Rust

I'm on a quest for the perfect home coffee brew. Any tips?
